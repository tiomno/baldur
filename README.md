Cloud-based RESTful API for connecDIMCloud powered by actionhero.js & Node.js
======================

Security Features
-------------

* Use of SSL protocol is mandatory.
* Every app that consumes the API must be registered to have a private key.
* Every single request is validated with a unique HMAC SHA256 hex digest signature.

actionhero RESTful API Framework
-------------------

### Main Components

* Automatic creation of language dictionary for localization. i18n module is embeded in the framework.
* Every _action_ has a callback function to build the response with easy access to the API and error objects.
* Every parameter _input_ has three callback functions to validate, format and return a default value if the _input_ is "", null or undefined.
* It's possible to keep several versions of an _action_ with automatic routes to access them. If the route is ommited, the last version of the _action_ is executed.
* actionhero has a set of commands to generate default templates for different types of modules (actions, tasks, initializers...)
* A documentation is automatically kept up to date for the frameworks and it's publish as part of the API.
* _Tasks_ can be defined to run in the background and can be triggered by the server or an _action_. The framework uses a [resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) ecosystem to accomplish this.
* Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) capabilities were introduced through the api.redis module. 
* actionhero ships with a Chat framework also which uses RPC heavily.
* It's possible to set up a cluster of nodes which uses redis to allow for pub/sub communication between nodes.
* actionhero ships with the functions needed for a distributed key-value cache.

### To start up actionhero server from the command line

`./node_modules/.bin/actionhero start`

or if it was globally installed

`actionhero start`

Then visit [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your browser to see the actionhero in action!

To consume the API use the following path `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/record`, e.g: [http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/status](http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/status) to get the API _status_ record.
